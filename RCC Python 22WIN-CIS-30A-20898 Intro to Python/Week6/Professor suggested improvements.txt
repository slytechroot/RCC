Attila,
Good job on this project. I appreciate the integration of TKCalendar, which I provided some bonus points to offset some missing elements. While program is functional, it is missing some requirements: classes, loops, and exception handling. Your program implemented methods for tasks and sub-tasks, such as switching options, which are great, but you can elevate this program by using classes and objects to improve data access control. User address can be stored in a dictionary and you can use a for-loop to access address components. I also recommend integration SQLite to manage customer data.

Attila,
Well done on project documentation and pseudocode. For future improvement, you want to improve program data structure and implement parallel processing for added performance. Consider using a larger container with while loop to allow user to add multiple appointments.
