21.0 Introduction
In order to provide the functionality you need to apply these concepts, this VM may require a minute or two to load.

The lab component for Chapters 20 and 21 is combined into this single lab, due to the nature of the material.

    In Chapter 20, we discussed creating partitions and filesystems.
    In Chapter 21, we demonstrated how to access the partitions and filesystems via mounting.

This lab combines these activities to avoid creating partitions twice.

As requirements for an active system grow and the number of users increases, it is often necessary to add additional hard drive space. When you add a drive to the system, you will need to create one or more partitions. Partitions are used to divide a hard drive into smaller chunks. Even if you don't want to divide a hard drive into smaller chunks, you will need to at least create a single partition to make use of the drive.

Once you have a partition, you will need to place a filesystem on the partition. After you create the filesystem, you will make the partition available via a mount point.

You may also need to add additional swap space to the system, either in the form of a swap partition or swap file. Swap space is virtual memory that is used by the system when RAM becomes full.
