22.14 Step 14

To change the reserved block count, you change the percentage of the filesystem that is reserved. This reserved amount can only be used by the root account and is set to 5% by default. Execute the following commands to change this value and confirm the change:

dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep "Reserved block count"
tune2fs -m 10 /dev/sda1
dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep "Reserved block count"

[root@centos~]# dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep "Reserved block count"
dumpe2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
Reserved block count:     6553
[root@centos~]# tune2fs -m 10 /dev/sda1
tune2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
Setting reserved blocks percentage to 10% (13107 blocks)
[root@centos~]# dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep "Reserved block count"
dumpe2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
Reserved block count:     13107
