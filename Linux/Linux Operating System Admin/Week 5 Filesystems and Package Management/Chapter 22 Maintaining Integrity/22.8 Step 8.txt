22.8 Step 8

The du command is useful because once you discover that a filesystem is close to becoming full, you need to determine where the largest chunks of files are. A common way of doing this is to see which of the directories under the root directory are using the most space. Execute the following command to see a demonstration:

du -sh /*

[root@centos~]# du -sh /*
0        /bin
100M     /boot
0        /dev
33M      /etc
20K      /home
0        /lib
0        /lib64
16K      /lost+found
4.0K     /media
4.0K     /mnt
4.0K     /opt

Some output has been omitted in the example above for brevity.
