23.31 Step 31

However, there is a second way to determine a backup superblock that will work on a filesystem that has a corrupted primary superblock. Execute the following command:

mke2fs -n /dev/sdb5

root@ubuntu:~# mke2fs -n /dev/sdb5
mke2fs 1.44.1 (24-Mar-2018)
Creating filesystem with 240800 1k blocks and 51200 inodes
Filesystem UUID: 71b895c4-e9f4-4e7a-992f-b90f6784094f
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
        8193, 24577, 40961, 57345, 73729

Important

Do not forget to include the -n option. Without the -n option, you would end up creating a new filesystem on that partition, resulting in complete data loss.
