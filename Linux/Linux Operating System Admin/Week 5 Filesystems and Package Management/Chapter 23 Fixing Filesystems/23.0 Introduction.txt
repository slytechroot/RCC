23.0 Introduction
In order to provide the functionality you need to apply these concepts, this VM may require a minute or two to load.

There are circumstances in which a filesystem may break. This can occur, for example, when the filesystem isn't properly shut down due to a power outage or a frustrated system administrator pulling the power on the system.

Because of how filesystem changes are made, filesystem corruption can occur when a filesystem isn't correctly unmounted. This is because changes to the filesystem metadata (information about the filesystem) are stored in memory initially. When a filesystem is unmounted correctly, all of this data is flushed to the hard drive.

When filesystems break, an administrator needs to know how to fix the problems. The fsck utility provides you with the tools to fix filesystems.
