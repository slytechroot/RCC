23.21 Step 21

Unmount the /dev/sda5 partition and then attempt to run the fsck utility on the /dev/sda5 filesystem by executing the following commands:

umount /dev/sdb5
fsck /dev/sdb5

root@ubuntu:~# umount /dev/sdb5
root@ubuntu:~# fsck /dev/sdb5
fsck from util-linux 2.31.1
e2fsck 1.44.1 (24-Mar-2018)
/dev/sdb5: clean, 11/51200 files, 12115/204800 blocks

The clean value indicates that this filesystem is either new or has been correctly unmounted. Therefore, there is no need to run fsck because the filesystem is not broken.
