23.34 Step 34

The most common time for a filesystem error to occur is during the boot process. In the last phase of this lab, you will create a filesystem error and fix it during the boot process. Start by using the nano editor to edit the /etc/fstab file:

nano /etc/fstab

root@ubuntu:~# nano /etc/fstab

Add the following line to the bottom of the /etc/fstab file:

/dev/sdb5	/data	ext4	defaults	0	0

If the /etc/fstab file is currently empty, make the line above the first and only line of the file.

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a 
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>    <type>  <options>      <dump>  <pass>
