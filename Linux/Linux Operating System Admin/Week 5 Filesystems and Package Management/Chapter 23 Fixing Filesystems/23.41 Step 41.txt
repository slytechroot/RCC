23.41 Step 41

Type the root password and press the Enter key. You will then be provided a command prompt:

netlab123
Enter

...
Give root password for maintenance
(or press Control-D to continue):
root@ubuntu:~#

At this prompt, type the following command to fix the filesystem:

fsck /dev/sdb5

root@ubuntu:~# fsck /dev/sdb5
fsck from util-linux 2.31.1
e2fsck 1.44.1 (24-Mar-2018)
/dev/sdb5 1.44.1 was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information 
Inode bitmap differences: Group 1 inode bitmap does not match checksum.
FIXED.
Block bitmap differences: Group 1 block bitmap does not match checksum.
FIXED.
 
/dev/sdb5: ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****
/dev/sdb5: 11/51200 files (0.0% non-contiguous), 12115/204800 blocks

Unlike the fsck utility that you run when logged in as root, the fsck utility that runs when in maintenance mode, as is the case here, knows to check backup superblocks automatically.
