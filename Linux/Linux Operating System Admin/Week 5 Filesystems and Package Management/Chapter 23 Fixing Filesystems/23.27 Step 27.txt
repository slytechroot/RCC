23.27 Step 27

To verify that the filesystem now has a problem, attempt to mount the filesystem by executing the following command:

mount /dev/sdb5 /data

root@ubuntu:~# mount /dev/sdb /data
mount: /data: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.

Normally, the mount command can determine the filesystem type by looking at values in the primary superblock. However, if that information can't be accessed, you will get the error message mount: you must specify the filesystem type.
