A well-thought-out disk partitioning scheme is vital to optimizing the use of system resources. While it is technically possible to make post-installation changes to partitions, this may be challenging and require system downtime. Therefore, it is important to consider how the system will be used before you begin creating partitions.

There are many components to take into consideration when creating a partitioning strategy. The focus of this chapter is to provide a firm understanding of these components, key terms, and important concepts regarding partitions.
