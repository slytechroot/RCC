15.4 Hardware Resources

In order for a device to work correctly, certain resources must be allocated to it. Originally, PCs had very limited resources that had to be manually managed; the administrator would have to set jumpers or switches on the devices to configure them for the resources that they would use. This was problematic, as a mistake might create a situation where one resource was being allocated to more than one device, resulting in one or both devices not working. In some cases, improper allocation of resources could even result in a non-functional system.

Not only are more resources available today, but they are also automatically allocated and managed by the operating system instead of manually by the administrator.

There are four types of hardware resources that devices use to communicate with the system. As some of these resources refer to input and output, part of their name may be abbreviated as IO. The four resources are: IO ports, IO memory, interrupt requests (IRQ), and direct memory access (DMA) channels:

    IO Ports - Memory addresses that allow for communication with hardware devices. The current system addresses in use can be viewed by executing the following command:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat /proc/ioports
    0000-0cf7 : PCI Bus 0000:00
      0000-001f : dma1
      0020-0021 : pic1
      0040-0043 : timer0
      0050-0053 : timer1
      0060-0060 : keyboard
      0064-0064 : keyboard
    Output Omitted...

    IO Memory - A section or location that acts much like the RAM that is presented to the processor via the system bus. These are used to pass and store data as well as for access to devices on the system. IO memory information can be viewed by executing the following command:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat /proc/iomem
    00010000-0009ffff : System RAM
    000a0000-000bffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
    000c0000-000c7fff : Video ROM
    000c8000-000cdfff : Adapter ROM
    000f0000-000fffff : System ROM
    00100000-be777fff : System RAM
      06000000-0680bdb2 : Kernel code
      0680bdb3-06f45abf : Kernel data
    Output Omitted...

    Interrupt Requests (IRQ) - An interrupt is a hardware signal that pauses or stops a running program so that the interrupt handler can switch to running another program, or send and receive data. There are a set of commonly-defined interrupts called IRQâ€™s that map to common interfaces, such as the system timer, keyboard controller, serial and parallel ports, and floppy controllers. The /proc/irq directory contains configuration information for each IRQ on the system.

    Direct Memory Access (DMA) - A method by which particular hardware items in the system can directly access RAM, without going through the CPU. This speeds up access, as the CPU would otherwise be fully tasked during such access, making it unavailable for other tasks for the duration. DMA information can be viewed by executing the following command:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat /proc/dma
     4: cascade

Note that, with the exception of interrupt requests, these resources cannot be shared between devices. Also, keep in mind that administrators rarely need to view this data on modern Linux systems as the configuration of devices is almost always transparent and automatic.
