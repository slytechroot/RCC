While Ubuntu mostly uses Upstart, there are a few traditional init scripts that you can see in the /etc/init.ddirectory:

1s /etc/init.d

root@ubuntu:~# ls /etc/init.d
apparmor           grub-common       kmod           plymouth     quotarpc udev
console-setup.sh  hwclock.sh         lvm2           plymouth-log rsync    ufw
cron              irqbalance         lvm2-lvmetad   procps       rsyslog  uuid
dbus              keyboard-setup.sh  lvm2-lvmpolld  quota        ssh

Most of these init scripts are for backward compatibility for older services. An example would be the ssh service functionality even though it is configured as an Upstart service.
