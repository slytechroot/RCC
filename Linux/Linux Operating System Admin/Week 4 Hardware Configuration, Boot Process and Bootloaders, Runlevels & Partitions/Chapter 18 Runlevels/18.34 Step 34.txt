18.34 Step 34

Use vi commands to make the change to the file:

Down Arrow
Right Arrow
i
Delete x3
+5
Esc
:wq!

Before

# control-alt-delete - emergency keypress handling
#
# This task is run whenever the Control-Alt-Delete key combination is
# pressed. Usually used to shut down the machine.
#
# Do not edit this file directly. If you want to change the behaviour,
# please create a file control-alt-delete.override and put your changes there.
 
start on control-alt-delete
 
exec /sbin/shutdown -r now "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"

After

# control-alt-delete - emergency keypress handling
#
# This task is run whenever the Control-Alt-Delete key combination is
# pressed. Usually used to shut down the machine.
#
# Do not edit this file directly. If you want to change the behaviour,
# please create a file control-alt-delete.override and put your changes there.
 
start on control-alt-delete
 
exec /sbin/shutdown -r +5 "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"

By replacing now with a +5, the shutdown command will wait 5 minutes before rebooting the system.
Do not attempt to perform a control-alt-delete after finishing the previous step. This was just a demonstration of how to create the file, not something designed to be tested in this virtual machine.
