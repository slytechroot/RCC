18.37 Step 37

Recall that the configuration files in the /etc/init.d directory determine which services are started at different run levels. For example, execute the following command to see which runlevels the ssh service starts:

grep runlevel /etc/init.d/ssh

root@ubuntu:~# grep runlevel /etc/init.d/ssh
([ "$previous" ] && [ "$runlevel" ]) || [ "$runlevel"= S ]

Note in the output above, the string "$runlevel"= S indicates that the runlevel is single user mode
