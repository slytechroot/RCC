View the contents of the /etc/init directory:

1s /etc/init

[root@centos ~]# ls /etc/init
control-alt-delete.conf  quit-plymouth.conf  serial.conf
init-system-dbus.conf    rc.conf             splash-manager.conf
kexec-disable.conf       rcS.conf            start-ttys.conf
plymouth-shutdown.conf   rcS-emergency.conf  tty.conf
prefdm.conf              rcS-sulogin.conf
[root@centos ~]#

Recall that the /etc/init directory is used by Upstart. If this distribution purely used Upstart (and no traditional init scripts), then there would be more files in this directory to define when services would start.
