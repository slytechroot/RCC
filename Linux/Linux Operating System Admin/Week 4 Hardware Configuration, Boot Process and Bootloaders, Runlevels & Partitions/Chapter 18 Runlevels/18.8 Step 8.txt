Use the more command to display the contents of the /etc/init.d/sshd file:

more /etc/init.d/sshd

#!/bin/bash
#
# sshd          Start up the OpenSSH server daemon
#
# chkconfig: 2345 55 25

Note that the third line of this file, Start up the OpenSSH server daemon, describes what this script does. The description line provides more details and the processname line provides the exact name of the process that this script starts and stops.
Suppose the description provided isn't really enough for you to understand what this service actually does. To learn more, you could look at the man page for sshd (although in this lab environment, the man pages don't exist, so this would be more of a "real world" solution).

To quit the more command, type Q.
