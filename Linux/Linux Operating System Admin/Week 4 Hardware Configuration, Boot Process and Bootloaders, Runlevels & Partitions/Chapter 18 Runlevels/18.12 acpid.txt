18.12 acpid

Linux systems use the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) event daemon acpid to notify user-space programs of ACPI events. The ACPI allows the kernel to configure hardware components and manage the system’s power settings, such as battery status monitoring, temperature, and more.

One example of using acpid for power management would be having the system shut down after the user presses the power button. On modern systems, acpid is normally started as a background process during bootup and opens an event file in the /proc/acpi directory. For example, the wakeup file in the /proc/acpi directory below displays the following information:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ su -
Password:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /proc/acpi
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 May 28 21:09 wakeup
root@localhost:~# cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
Device  S-state   Status   Sysfs node
PCI0      S5    *disabled  no-bus:pci0000:00
root@localhost:~#

When the kernel sends out an ACPI event, acpid will determine the next steps based on rules defined in configuration files in the /etc/acpi directory. Administrators can create rules scripts in the /etc/acpi directory to control the actions taken by the system.

The acpi command is used to display information about system hardware ACPI settings. It’s not installed on our VM, but the above example shows a basic acpi script in the /proc/acpi directory that controls waking the machine up after being suspended. There are many options available to the acpi command to display various information for power management. The table below summarizes some of the options available to the acpi command:
Option 	Purpose

-b

--battery
	Displays battery information

-a

--ac-adapter
	Displays ac adapter information

-t

--thermal
	Displays thermal information

-c

--cooling
	Displays cooling device information

-s

--show-empty
	Displays non-operational devices

-f

--fahrenheit
	Uses Fahrenheit as the temperature unit instead of the default, Celsius

-i

--details
	Displays additional details if they are available; battery capacity and temperature trip points

Note
The acpi command does not exist in our virtual environment.
