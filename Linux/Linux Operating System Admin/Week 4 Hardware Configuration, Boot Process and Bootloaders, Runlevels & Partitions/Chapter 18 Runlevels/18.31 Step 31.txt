# control-alt-delete - emergency keypress handling
#
# This task is run whenever the Control-Alt-Delete key combination is
# pressed. Usually used to shut down the machine.
#
# Do not edit this file directly. If you want to change the behaviour,
# please create a file control-alt-delete.override and put your changes there.
 
start on control-alt-delete
 
exec /sbin/shutdown -r now "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"
[root@centos ~]#

If you look at the last line of this file, you will see that is someone performs a Control-Alt-Delete, the shutdown command would be executed. The system would be rebooted immediately after the shutdown command sends everyone the message Control-Alt-Delete pressed.
Note that you should not modify this file directly. Instead, create a file called control-alt-delete.override and specify your customizations in that file.
