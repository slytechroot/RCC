10.11 Step 11

Command pipelines are often used to make effective use of filter commands. In a command pipeline, the output of one command is sent to another command as input. In Linux and most operating systems, the vertical bar or pipe | character is used between two commands to represent a command pipeline.

Redirect the text output by the history command to the grep command as input by using the following command:

history | grep "cat"

sysadmin@localhost:~$ history | grep "cat"
    4  cat ls_output.txt
    6  cat ls_output.txt
   10  cat error.txt
   12  cat find output.txt
   13  cat find_output.txt
   14  cat find_error.txt
   19  cat find_output.txt
   20  cat /etc/hosts
   23  cat ~/myhosts
   25  history | grep "cat"

In the example above, the grep command matches the cat strings in the command history and sends its output to standard out.
