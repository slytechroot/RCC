10.2 Step 2

Redirecting standard output with two greater-than >> characters will result in the output of the command being appended to the end of a file if it does already exist.

To append the output of the date command to the ls_output.txt file created in the previous step, execute the following command:

date >> ls_output.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ date >> ls_output.txt

The number 1 is associated with the standard output file descriptor when used with the > and >> operators. The number is implied in the examples shown above; the example can also be written as date 1 >> ls_output.txt.

To view the contents of the ls_output.txt file, use the following command:

cat ls_output.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat ls_output.txt
