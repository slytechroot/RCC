10.12 Step 12

The pipe | symbol can be used multiple times within a command. To extract some fields from the /etc/passwd file, sort them, and finally eliminate duplicate lines, execute the following command:

cut –f7 –d: /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -c

sysadmin@localhost:~$  cut -f7 -d: /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -c
      3 /bin/bash
      1 /bin/sync
     24 /usr/sbin/nologin

The previous command extracted the seventh field from the /etc/passwd file with the cut command, then sorted those lines with the sort command, and finally, eliminated duplicate lines with the uniq command.
The -c option to the uniq command will prefix lines in the output with the total number of occurrences of that line in the file specified.
