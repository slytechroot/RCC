The tee command is used to write standard output to more than one place, and as such, it is useful to view output at the terminal and also write it to a file. The following command will list the contents of the home directory at the terminal and also create a text file called homedir.txt with the same information:

ls -l | tee homedir.txt
cat homedir.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l | tee homedir.txt
