Both input as well as output redirection can be used together in the same command. To translate all the lower-case characters in the /etc/hosts file to upper-case characters and save the output in the ~/myhosts file, execute the following command:

tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < /etc/hosts > ~/myhosts

sysadmin@localhost:~$ tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < /etc/hosts > ~/myhosts

To view the redirected standard input and standard output in the contents of the ~/myhosts file, use the following command:

cat ~/myhosts

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat ~/myhosts
