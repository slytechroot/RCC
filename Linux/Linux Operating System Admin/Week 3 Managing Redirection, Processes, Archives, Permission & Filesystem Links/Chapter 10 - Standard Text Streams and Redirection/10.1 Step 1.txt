10.1 Step 1

Standard output is redirected using the greater-than > character followed by the name of the file to which it will be written. Redirecting output using a single greater-than > character will create a new file, or overwrite the contents of an existing file with the same name. To redirect the output of the ls command to the ls_output.txt file, execute the following command:

ls > ls_output.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls > ls_output.txt

To view the contents of the newly created ls_output.txt file, use the following command:

cat ls_output.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat ls_output.txt
