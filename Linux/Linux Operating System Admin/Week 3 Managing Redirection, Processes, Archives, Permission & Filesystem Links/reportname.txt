				Project VIM Nano Report

	Linux today is being used to support a wide variety of devices such as space robots, in-flight entertainment, digital signage, nuclear submarines and even our own computers. This is the part I like best: breathing new life into old computers that people throw out as obsolete. These newold systems could be used to make someone else's life easier and better. I remember the old days of college when my parents could not afford to buy me a computer and I would rely on the school labs to get whatever keyboard knowledge I could get. I would also use the internet cafe at night to learn how to type and browse online. I wish i had had a computer to learn coding and scripting on. It's been 20 years since and I have many computers, even a virtual environment at home I can run just about any  operating system on. I still wish I had had a physical laptop back then.  


	I would choose Linux over Microsoft because of expensive licensing structures, too many 
security issues, the need to always patch-patch. It's a hassle. After being in this class Linux 
Mint caught my attention and it seems to be a small robust, easily implemented to run, 
excellent hardware and software support and with Office Libre it makes it even more convenient
to use Linux on personal laptops and desktops. Linux mint would be the perfect option for old 
computers with dual cores, no need to solid state hard drives, and fancy graphics card to run 
normal home or small office tasks. We need to stop this culture of throw-away good computers and
breathe new life into old hardware with Linux. 

	I hope to be able to join the NetaCad.com Linux II course to learn more about Linux. It
was cancelled for the support due to low student signup.
