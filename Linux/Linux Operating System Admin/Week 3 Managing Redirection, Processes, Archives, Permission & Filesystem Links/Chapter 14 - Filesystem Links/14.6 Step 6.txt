14.6 Step 6

Delete the /tmp/hosts file and attempt to view the /var/hosts file again by executing the following commands:

rm /tmp/hosts
y
more /var/hosts

[root@localhost ~]# rm /tmp/hosts                                           
rm: remove regular file '/tmp/hosts'? y                                     
[root@localhost ~]# more /var/hosts                                         
/var/hosts: No such file or directory

Note the strange error message No such file or directory. The /var/hosts file does exist, but when it follows the link, the system can't find the /tmp/hosts file, which results in the error message. This is the primary weakness of soft links.
