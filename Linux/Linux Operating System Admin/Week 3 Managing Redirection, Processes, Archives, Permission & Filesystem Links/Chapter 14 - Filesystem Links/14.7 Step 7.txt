14.7 Step 7

View the listing of the /var/hosts file by executing the following command:

ls -l /var/hosts

[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /var/hosts                                         
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Apr 19 16:01 /var/hosts -> /tmp/hosts

The red color in the filename indicates something is wrong; in this case a broken link.
