14.2 Step 2

Execute the following command to see a soft link file:

ls -l /etc/rc.local

[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /etc/rc.local                                         
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Feb  4  2016 /etc/rc.local -> rc.d/rc.local

Note that soft links are easy to see as the file type (first character before permissions) is a letter l and the filename includes the link.
