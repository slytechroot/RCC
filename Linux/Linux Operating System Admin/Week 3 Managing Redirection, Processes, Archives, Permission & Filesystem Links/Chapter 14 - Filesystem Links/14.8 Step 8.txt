14.8 Step 8

Soft links can also be made to directories. For example, execute the following commands:

ln -s /etc/yum /tmp/yum-files
ls -l /tmp/yum-files
ls -l /tmp/yum-files/

[root@localhost ~]# ln -s /etc/yum /tmp/yum-files                               
[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /tmp/yum-files                                        
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Apr 19 17:20 /tmp/yum-files -> /etc/yum                
[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /tmp/yum-files/                                       
total 20                                                                        
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Nov  5 01:53 fssnap.d                               
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec  4 14:39 pluginconf.d                           
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Mar 29 19:23 protected.d                            
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec  4 14:38 vars

Soft links to directories are tricky. If you just refer to the soft link (like the first ls command above), only the soft link itself will be displayed. If you add a trailing / character to the end of the soft link name, then it follows the soft link and displays the contents of the directory that the soft link is linked to.
