14.3 Step 3

Execute the following command to view the file that the /etc/rc.local file is pointing to:

ls -l /etc/rc.d/rc.local

[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /etc/rc.d/rc.local                                    
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 220 Dec 15  2015 /etc/rc.d/rc.local

Note that when the link is followed, the permissions on the real file are what is used to provide access to the file. As a result, soft link files typically have the permissions of rwxrwxrwx while the files that they point to have real permissions.
