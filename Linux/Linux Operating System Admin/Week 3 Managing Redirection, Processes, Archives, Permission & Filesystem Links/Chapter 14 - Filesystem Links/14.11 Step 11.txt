14.11 Step 11

You can tell that these files are all hard linked together by using the -i option to the ls command:

ls -i

[root@localhost test]# ls -i                                                    
132383356 crontab  132383356 hcrontab  132383356 newcrontab

Because all of these files share the same inode number, they are hard linked together.
