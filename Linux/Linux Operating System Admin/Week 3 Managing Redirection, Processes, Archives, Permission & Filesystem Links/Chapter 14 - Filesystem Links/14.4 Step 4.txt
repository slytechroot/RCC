14.4 Step 4

Execute the following commands to copy a file to the /tmp directory and then create a soft link to this file:

cp /etc/hosts /tmp
ln -s /tmp/hosts /var/hosts
ls -l /var/hosts
ls -l /tmp/hosts

[root@localhost ~]# cp /etc/hosts /tmp                                       
[root@localhost ~]# ln -s /tmp/hosts /var/hosts                    
[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /var/hosts                                         
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Apr 19 16:01 /var/hosts -> /tmp/hosts              
[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /tmp/hosts                                        
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 172 Apr 19 16:01 /tmp/hosts

Note that while it is easy to see that /var/hosts points to the /tmp/hosts file, it is impossible to determine a soft link from the file that is being pointed to. In other words, listing the /tmp/hosts file doesn't tell you that the /var/hosts file points to it.
