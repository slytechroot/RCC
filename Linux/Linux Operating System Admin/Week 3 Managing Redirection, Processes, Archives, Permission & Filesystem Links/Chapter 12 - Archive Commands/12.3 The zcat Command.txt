12.3 The zcat Command

The zcat command is used to display the contents of a compressed file without actually uncompressing it. It does this by expanding the file contents to standard output rather than creating a new uncompressed file from a compressed archive created by the tar or gzip commands. Its effect is identical to running the gunzip -c command:

zcat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

First, create a compressed file with the gzip command, then view its contents with the zcat command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Documents
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ gzip red.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ ls
School            alpha-third.txt  hidden.txt    numbers.txt  spelling.txt
Work              alpha.txt        letters.txt   os.csv       words
adjectives.txt    animals.txt      linux.txt     people.csv
alpha-first.txt   food.txt         longfile.txt  profile.txt
alpha-second.txt  hello.sh         newhome.txt   red.txt.gz
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ zcat red.txt.gz
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read

The zcat command can also be used to view the contents of multiple compressed files:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ gzip letters.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ zcat red.txt.gz letters.txt.gz
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read                                                                            
a
b
c
d
e

Using the -f option with the zcat command will enable viewing of normal uncompressed files:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ zcat -f newhome.txt
Thanks for purchasing your new home!!

**Warning** it may be haunted.

There are three bathrooms.

**Beware** of the ghost in the bedroom.

The kitchen is open for entertaining.

**Caution** the spirits don't like guests.

Good luck!!!

File properties can be displayed with the -l option:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ zcat -l red.txt.gz
         compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name
                 60                  51  33.3% red.txt
