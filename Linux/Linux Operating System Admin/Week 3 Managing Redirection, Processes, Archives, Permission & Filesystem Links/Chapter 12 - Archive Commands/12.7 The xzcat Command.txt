12.7 The xzcat Command

The xzcat command is used to print the contents of files compressed with the xz command to standard output on the terminal without uncompressing the target file.

xzcat [FILE]...

In the following example, the xz command is used to compress the animals.txt file, and then the xzcat command is used to view the file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ xz animals.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ ls
School            alpha-third.txt  hidden.txt      numbers.txt   words
Work              alpha.txt        letters.txt.gz  os.csv
adjectives.txt    animals.txt.xz   linux.txt       people.csv
alpha-first.txt   food.txt         longfile.txt    red.txt.gz
alpha-second.txt  hello.sh         newhome.txt     spelling.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ xzcat animals.txt.xz
1 retriever
2 badger
3 bat
4 wolf
5 eagle

As demonstrated in the output above, when a new compressed file is created, the .xz extension is added to the file name.
