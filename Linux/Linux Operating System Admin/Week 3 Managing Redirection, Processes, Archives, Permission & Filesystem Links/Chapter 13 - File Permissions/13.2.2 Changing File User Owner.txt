13.2.2 Changing File User Owner

Initially, the owner of a file is the user who creates it. The user owner can only be changed by a user with root privileges using the chown command. Using the syntax below, the root user can change the owner of the FILE to the OWNER account.

chown [OPTION]... [OWNER] FILE...

For instance, a new file called nullfile will be created in the Documents directory:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Documents
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ touch nullfile

Using the ls -l command, we can see that the owner of this file is the sysadmin user:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ ls -l nullfile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Mar 21 17:30 nullfile

Next, the sudo command can be used with the chown command to change the ownership of the new file to the root user, and the ls -l command is used to verify the change:

Note

The password of the sysadmin user in our virtual machine environment is netlab123.

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ sudo chown root
nullfile
[sudo] password for sysadmin:
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ ls -l nullfile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root sysadmin 0 Mar 21 17:30 nullfile

The information displayed in the output of the ls -l command about the nullfile file indicates that the user owner of the file is now the root user.
