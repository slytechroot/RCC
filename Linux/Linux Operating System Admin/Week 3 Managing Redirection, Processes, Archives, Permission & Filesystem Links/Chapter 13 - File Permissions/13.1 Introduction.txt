13.1 Introduction

In order to access or modify a file or directory, the correct permissions must be set. There are three different permissions that can be placed on a file or directory: read, write, and execute.

When listing a file with the ls -l command, the output includes permission and ownership information:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /bin/ls
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 133792 Jan 18  2018 /bin/ls

Below is a refresher on the fields relevant to permissions.
File Type Field

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 133792 Jan  18  2018 /bin/ls

The first character of this output indicates the type of a file. Recall if the first character is a dash - character, as in the previous example, this is a regular file. If the character was a letter d, it would be a directory.

If the first character of the output of the ls -l command is a letter l, then the file is a symbolic link. A symbolic link file "points to" another file in the file system.

Note

To access a file that a symbolic link points to, you need to have the appropriate permissions on both the symbolic link file and the file that it points to.
Permissions Field

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 133792 Jan  18  2018 /bin/ls

After the file type character, the permissions are displayed.
User Owner Field

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 133792 Jan  18  2018 /bin/ls

After the link count, the file's user owner is displayed.
Group Owner Field

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 133792 Jan  18  2018 /bin/ls

After the user owner field, the file group owner is displayed.
