13.36 Step 36

Normally, when you create a new file, the group ownership of the new file is set to your primary group. Create a new file called labfile.txt in the /srv/test directory and verify by executing the following commands:

touch /srv/test/labfile.txt
ls -l /srv/test/labfile.txt

root@localhost:~# touch /srv/test/labfile.txt
root@localhost:~# ls -l /srv/test/labfile.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 May 17 01:14 /srv/test/labfile.txt

The group owner of this new file is the root user's primary group, which is also called root.
