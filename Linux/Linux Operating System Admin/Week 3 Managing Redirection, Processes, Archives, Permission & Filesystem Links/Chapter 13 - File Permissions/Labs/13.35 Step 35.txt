13.35 Step 35

It is possible for the user owner of a file or directory to change the group owner of that same file/directory by using the chgrp command. Verify that the team group exists and then change the group ownership of the /srv/test directory to the team group by executing the following commands:

chgrp team /srv/test
ls -ld /srv/test

root@localhost:~# grep team /etc/group
team:x:1004:
root@localhost:~# chgrp team /srv/test
root@localhost:~# ls -ld /srv/test
drwxr-xr-x 2 root team 4096 May 17 00:56 /srv/test

The chgrp command was used above to change the group owner of the /srv/test directory from the default primary group root to the group team.
