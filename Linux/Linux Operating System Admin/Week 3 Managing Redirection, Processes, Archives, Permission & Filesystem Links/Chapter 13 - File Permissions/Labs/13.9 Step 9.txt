13.9 Step 9

The chmod command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. Only the root user or the user who owns the file is able to change the permissions of a file.

chmod MODE FILEâ€¦

There are two techniques of changing permissions with the chmod command: symbolic and octal. To use the symbolic method of chmod, use the symbols summarized in the table below:
Group Symbol 	Operation Symbol 	Permission Symbol
u (user owner) 	+ (add the permission) 	r (read)
g (group owner) 	= (specify the exact permission) 	w (write)
o (others) 	- (remove the permission) 	x (execute)
a (all) 		

Remove the ability of the sysadmin account (who belongs to the others permission set) to view the /srv/lab.txt file by executing the following command:

chmod o-r /srv/lab.txt

root@localhost:~# chmod o-r /srv/lab.txt
