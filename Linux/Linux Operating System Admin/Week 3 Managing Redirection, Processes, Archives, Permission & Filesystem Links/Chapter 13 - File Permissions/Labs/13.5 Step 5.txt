13.5 Step 5

View the permissions of this file and notice that all users can view the file contents since all users have read permission for the file:

ls -l /srv/lab.txt

Be aware that both instances in the command above use a lowercase "L", not a number one.

root@localhost:~# ls -l /srv/lab.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 27 May 16 12:29 /srv/lab.txt
