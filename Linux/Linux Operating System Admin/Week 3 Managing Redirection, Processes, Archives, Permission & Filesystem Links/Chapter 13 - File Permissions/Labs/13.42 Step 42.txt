Execute the following command to delete the previously created file. When prompted with the message, rm: remove write-protected regular empty file `/pub/myfile'?, type the Y key and then press Enter:

rm /pub/mylabfile
Y
Enter
ls -l /pub

sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm /pub/mylabfile
rm: remove write-protected regular empty file '/pub/myfile'? y
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /pub
total 0

Notice that the sysadmin user was able to delete a file owned by the root user. This is because the write permission of a directory grants the ability to add and delete files in a directory.
