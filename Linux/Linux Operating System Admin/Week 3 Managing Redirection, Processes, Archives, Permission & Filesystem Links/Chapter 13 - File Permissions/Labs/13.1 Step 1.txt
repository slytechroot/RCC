13.1 Step 1

In order to access or modify a file or directory, the correct permissions must be set. There are three different permissions that can be placed on a file or directory: read, write, and execute.

Execute the following command to list details about the /etc/shadow file:

ls -l /etc/shadow

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 968 Apr 17 22:31 /etc/shadow

The following is a breakdown of the fields relevant to file and directory permissions:
File Type Field

-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 968 Apr 17 22:31 /etc/shadow

The first character of this output indicates the type of a file. Recall if the first character is a dash - character, as it is in the output above, this is a regular file. If the character was a letter d, it would be a directory.
Permissions Field

-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 968 Apr 17 22:31 /etc/shadow

After the file type character, the permissions are displayed.
User Owner Field

-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 968 Apr 17 22:31 /etc/shadow

After the link count, the file's user owner is displayed.
Group Owner Field

-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 968 Apr 17 22:31 /etc/shadow

After the user owner field, the file group owner is displayed.

Note that the user owner of the /etc/shadow file is the root user and that the group owner is the shadow group. The user owner has read and write permission (rw-), the group owner only has the read permission (r--), and regular users have no permissions (---).
