13.51 Step 51

Execute the following commands to change the umask to 002 and verify that this results in all new directories having the permission set of rwxrwxr-x:

umask 002
mkdir mydir2
ls -ld mydir2

sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask 002
sysadmin@localhost:~$ mkdir mydir2
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -ld mydir2
drwxrwxr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Apr 18 20:25 mydir2

Recall that umask values, when set in the shell, are not permanent. To make a umask that will apply to every shell that you open, add the umask command line to your ~/.bashrc file.
