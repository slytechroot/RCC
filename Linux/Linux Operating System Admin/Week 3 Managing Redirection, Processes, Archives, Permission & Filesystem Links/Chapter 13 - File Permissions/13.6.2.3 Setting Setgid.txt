13.6.2.3 Setting Setgid

Use the following syntax to add the setgid permission symbolically:

chmod g+s <file|directory>

To add the setgid permission numerically, add 2000 to the file's existing permissions (assume in the following example that the directory originally had 775 for its permissions):

chmod 2775 <file|directory>

To remove the setgid permission symbolically, run:

chmod g-s <file|directory>

To remove the setgid permission numerically, subtract 2000 from the file's existing permissions:

chmod 0775 <file|directory>
