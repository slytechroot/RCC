Question

Given the following information, who can delete the /home/bob/test file?

drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Apr 23 21:08 /
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Apr 17 22:31 /home
drwxrwxrwx 1 bob  staff 4096 Apr 23 21:09 /home/bob
-rwx------ 1 bob  staff 390  Apr 17 22:31 /home/bob/test

Answer

All users on the system can. Recall that to delete a file, a user needs write and execute permissions on the directory that the file is stored in. All users have write and execute permission on the /home/bob directory. This is a huge mistake because now all users can delete all files in the home directory of the user bob.
