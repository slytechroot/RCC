13.5.2.1 Answer
Question

Given the following information, can the user bob delete the /home/bob/test file?

drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Apr 23 21:08 /
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Apr 17 22:31 /home
drwxr-xr-x 1 bob  staff 4096 Apr 23 21:09 /home/bob
---------- 1 bob  staff 390  Apr 17 22:31 /home/bob/test

Answer

Yes. While it may seem like the user bob shouldn't be able to delete this file because he has no permissions on the file itself, to delete a file a user needs to have write permission in the directory that the file is stored in. File permissions do not apply when deleting a file.
