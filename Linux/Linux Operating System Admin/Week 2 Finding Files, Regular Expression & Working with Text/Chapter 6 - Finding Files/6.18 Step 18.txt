6.18 Step 18

The type command can be used to determine information about various commands.

type [OPTION]... NAME...

To find out which specific file the less command originates from, execute the following command:

type less

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type less                                                
less is /usr/bin/less

The output of the command above is similar to the output of the which command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ which less
/usr/bin/less

To reveal all the paths of the less command, execute the type command with the -a option:

type -a less

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type -a less
less is /usr/bin/less                                                           
less is /bin/less
