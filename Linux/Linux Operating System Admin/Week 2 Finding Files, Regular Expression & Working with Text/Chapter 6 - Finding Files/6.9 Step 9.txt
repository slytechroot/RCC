6.9 Step 9

To display a count of all of the files in the /etc directory structure that end in .conf, execute the following command:

find /etc -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null | wc -l

Be aware that the last option in the command above is a lowercase "L", not a number one.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ find /etc -name "*conf" 2>/dev/null | wc -l           
92
