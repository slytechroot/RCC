6.3.5 type Command

The type command can be used to determine information about various commands.

type [OPTION]... NAME...

Some commands originate from a specific file:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type which                                                
which is /usr/bin/which

This output would be similar to the output of the which command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ which which
/usr/bin/which

The type command can also identify commands that are built into the Bash (or other) shell:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type echo
echo is a shell builtin

This output is significantly different than the output of the which command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ which echo
/bin/echo

Using the -a option, the type command can also reveal the path of another command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type -a echo
echo is a shell builtin
echo is /bin/echo

The type command can also identify aliases to other commands:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type ll
ll is aliased to `ls -alF'
sysadmin@localhost:~$ type ls
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'

The output of these commands indicates that ll is an alias for ls -alF, and even ls is an alias for ls --color=auto. Again, the output is significantly different than the which command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ which ll
sysadmin@localhost:~$ which ls
/bin/ls

The type command supports other options, and can lookup multiple commands simultaneously. To display only a single word describing the echo, ll, and which commands, use the -t option:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ type -t echo ll which
builtin
alias
file
