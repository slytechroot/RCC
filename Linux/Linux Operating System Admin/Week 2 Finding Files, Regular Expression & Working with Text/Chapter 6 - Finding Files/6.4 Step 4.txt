The find command has options to find files per their timestamps. To find all files in the /etc directory which were modified less than 2 days ago, execute the following command:

find /etc -mtime -2 2>/dev/null

sysadmin@localhost:~$ find /etc -mtime -2 2>/dev/null                      
/etc                                                                        
/etc/alternatives                                                           
/etc/alternatives/editor                                                    
/etc/alternatives/editor.pl.1.gz                                            
/etc/alternatives/editor.fr.1.gz                                            
/etc/alternatives/editor.it.1.gz                                            
/etc/alternatives/editor.ru.1.gz                                            
/etc/alternatives/editor.ja.1.gz                                            
/etc/alternatives/editor.1.gz                                               
/etc/subgid                                                                 
/etc/skel                                                                   
/etc/skel/.bashrc                                                           
/etc/skel/.selected_editor                                                  
/etc/hosts                                                                  
/etc/gshadow                                                               
/etc/resolv.conf
