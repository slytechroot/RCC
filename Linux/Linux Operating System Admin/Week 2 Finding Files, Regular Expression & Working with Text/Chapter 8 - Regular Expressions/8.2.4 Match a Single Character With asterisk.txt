8.2.4 Match a Single Character With *

The asterisk * operator is used to match zero or more occurrences of the character preceding it. For example, the e* pattern would match zero or more occurrences of the e character:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
rood
read
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt | grep 're*d'
red
reeed
rd
reed

It is also possible to match zero or more occurrences of a list of characters by utilizing the square brackets:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt | grep 'r[oe]*d'
red
reeed
rd
rod
reed
rood

When used with only one other character, the asterisk * operator isn't very helpful. Any of the following patterns would match every string or line in the file: '.*' 'e*' 'b*' 'z*' This is because the asterisk * operator can match zero occurrences of a pattern.

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt | grep 'z*'
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt | grep 'e*'
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read

In order to make the asterisk * operator useful, it is necessary to create a pattern which includes more than just the one character preceding the asterisk * operator. For example, the results above can be refined by adding another e to make the pattern ee* effectively matching every line which contains at least one e.

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt | grep 'ee*'
red
reef
reeed
reed
reel
read
