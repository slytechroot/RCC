The grep command provides the -i option for making the pattern matching case insensitive. To match both upper and lower case of the abid pattern in the /usr/share/dict/words file, execute the following command:

grep â€“i "abid" /usr/share/dict/words

sysadmin@localhost:~$ grep -i "abid" /usr/share/dict/words
