8.8 Step 8

In basic regular expressions, putting a backslash \ character in front of another character means to match that character literally. For example, using the \. pattern is an appropriate way to match the . character.

To display the file names of the files in the /etc directory that start with the letters rc, followed by a digit in the range 3-6, and ending in the file extension .d, execute the following command with the regular expression rc[3-6]*\.d:

ls /etc | grep 'rc[3-6]*\.d'

 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc | grep 'rc[3-6]*\.d'
rc3.d
rc4.d
rc5.d
rc6.d

In the command above, the asterisk * operator is used to find zero or more instances of digit characters in the range 3-6.
