8.2.2 Match a Single Character With .

One of the most useful matching capabilities is provided by the period . operator. It will match any character except for the new line character. The red.txt file contains a list of words:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat red.txt
red
reef
rot
reeed
rd
rod
roof
reed
root
reel
read

The r..t pattern will find any line that contained the letter r followed by exactly two characters (which can be any character except a newline) and then the letter t:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep r..t red.txt
root
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep r..f red.txt
reef
roof
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep r..d red.txt
reed
read
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep r.d red.txt
red
rod

Remember, the line does not have to be an exact match, it simply must contain the pattern, as seen here when the r..t pattern is searched for in the /etc/passwd file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep r..t /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
operator:x:1000:37::/root:
