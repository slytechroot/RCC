8.17 Step 17

Special characters, such as the asterisk * operator and the plus + operator, need to be escaped using the backslash \ character to avoid their interpretation as a special character during expression evaluation. To find all occurrences of the pattern * in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file, execute the following command:

grep "\*" /etc/rsyslog.conf

sysadmin@localhost:~$ grep "\*" /etc/rsyslog.conf
$IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
