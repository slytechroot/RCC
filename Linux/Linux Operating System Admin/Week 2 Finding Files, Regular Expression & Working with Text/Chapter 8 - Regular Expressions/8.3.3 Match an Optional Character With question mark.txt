8.3.3 Match an Optional Character With ?

The extended regex question mark ? operator matches the preceding character or grouping zero or one times, making it optional. For example, consider the word color, which can also be spelled with an optional u as colour (depending on the English dialect being used). Use the colou?r pattern to match either spelling:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep -E 'colou?r' spelling.txt
American English: Do you consider gray to be a color or a shade?
British English: Do you consider grey to be a colour or a shade?

Pattern 	Meaning
xyz? 	Matches the xy string followed by zero or one of the z character
x(yz)? 	Matches the x character followed by zero or one of the yz string
