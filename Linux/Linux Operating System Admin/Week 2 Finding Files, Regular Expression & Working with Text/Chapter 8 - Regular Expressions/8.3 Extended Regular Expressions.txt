8.3 Extended Regular Expressions

While most commands that use regular expressions can interpret basic regular expressions, the use of extended regular expressions often requires a special option be provided to the command to recognize them.

Extended regular expression patterns support the basic regex operators PLUS the following additional operators:
Extended Regex 	Operators 	Meaning
Grouping operator 	( ) 	Groups characters together to form a subpattern.
Asterisk operator 	* 	Previous character (or subpattern) is present zero or more times.
Plus operator 	+ 	Previous character (or subpattern) is present at least one or more times.
Question mark operator 	? 	Previous character (or subpattern) is present zero or one time (but not more).
Curly brace operator 	{,} 	Specify minimum, maximum, or exact matches of the previous character (or subpattern).
Alternation operator 	| 	Logical OR of choices. For example, abc|def|xyz matches abc or def or xyz.

The grep command understands both basic and extended regular expressions. By default, the grep command assumes only basic regular expressions, meaning the +, ?, {, |, (, and ) operators are interpreted as literal characters.

Historically, there is a command called egrep, which is similar to the grep command, but can understand extended regular expressions. Now, the egrep command is deprecated in favor of using grep with the -E option.

Note

The term subpattern introduced above will be covered in the next section.
