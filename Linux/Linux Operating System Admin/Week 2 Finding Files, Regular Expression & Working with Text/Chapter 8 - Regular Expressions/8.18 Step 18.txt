8.18 Step 18

An alternative to using the backslash \ character to escape every special character is to use the fgrep command, which always treats its pattern as literal characters.

To match the * pattern in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file, execute the following command:

fgrep "*" /etc/rsyslog.conf

sysadmin@localhost:~$ fgrep "*" /etc/rsyslog.conf
$IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
