8.2 Basic Regular Expressions

The simplest of all regular expressions just use literal characters, such as alphanumeric characters. For example, to locate all lines of the /etc/passwd file that contain the expression root, use the following command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ grep 'root' /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:bin/bash
operator:x:11:0:operator:/root:/sbin/nologin

Although very useful for the grep command, literal characters alone provide no wildcarding or special matching capabilities. For that, letâ€™s introduce the operators that are available in basic regular expressions.
Basic Regex 	Operator 	Meaning
Period operator 	. 	Matches any one single character.
List operator 	

[ ]

[^ ]
	Defines a list or range of literal characters that can match one character. If the first character is the negation ^ operator, it matches any character that is not in the list.
Asterisk operator 	* 	Matches zero or more instances of the previous character.
Front anchor operator 	^ 	If ^ is the first character in the pattern, then the entire pattern must be present at the beginning of the line to match. If ^ is not the first character, then it is treated as an ordinary literal ^ character.
Back anchor operator 	$ 	If $ is the last character in the pattern, then the pattern must be at the end of the line to match, otherwise, it is treated as a literal $ character.
