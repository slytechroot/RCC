8.0 Introduction

Regular expressions are patterns interpreted by certain commands. The patterns are enclosed in single quotes to prevent the shell from misinterpreting them. Regular expressions differ from globbing, which is a function performed by the shell and therefore not associated directly with any command.

The grep command is used to demonstrate the use of regular expressions.

There are two types of regular expressions â€“ basic and extended. While the basic expressions are interpreted by most commands, the extended expressions can be used along with an option in commands that support their interpretation.
