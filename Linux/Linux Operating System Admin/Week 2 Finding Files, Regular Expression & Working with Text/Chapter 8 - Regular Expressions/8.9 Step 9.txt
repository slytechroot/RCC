8.9 Step 9

The use of extended regular expressions often requires a special option to be provided to the command to recognize them. The grep -E command is used to recognize the extended regular expression character. Extended regular expression patterns support the basic regex operators PLUS the following additional operators:
Extended Regex 	Operators 	Meaning
Grouping operator 	( ) 	Groups characters together to form a subpattern.
Asterisk operator 	* 	Previous character (or subpattern) is present zero or more times.
Plus operator 	+ 	Previous character (or subpattern) is present at least one or more times.
Question mark operator 	? 	Previous character (or subpattern) is present zero or one time (but not more).
Curly brace operator 	{,} 	Specify minimum, maximum, or exact matches of the previous character (or subpattern).
Alternation operator 	| 	Logical OR of choices. For example, abc|def|xyz matches abc or def or xyz.

As indicated in the table above, the plus + operator is used to match one or more instances of the previous value. Execute the following command to match a colon : character, followed by one or more numbers, followed by another colon : character:

tail /etc/passwd | grep -E ':[0-9]+:' 

sysadmin@localhost:~$ tail /etc/passwd | grep -E ':[0-9]+:'
