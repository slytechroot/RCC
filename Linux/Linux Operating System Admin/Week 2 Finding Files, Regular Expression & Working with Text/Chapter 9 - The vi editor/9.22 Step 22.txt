9.22 Step 22

To use nano to view and edit the .bashrc file, use the following command:

nano .bashrc

sysadmin@localhost:~$ nano .bashrc

The .bashrc file contains the environment variables for the standard editor at the bottom of the file. Unlike vi , nano allows you to simply use the Arrow Keys ←↑→↓ to navigate to any place in the document. Use the Down Arrow ↓ key to scroll to the bottom of the file:

   GNU nano 2.9.3                           .bashrc

  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
fi


# add user bin to path
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

# set editor and visual envs to vim
EDITOR=vi
VISUAL=vi

# change to home dir
cd ~
