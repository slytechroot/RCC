7.15 Counting Lines in a File

The wc command can be used to analyze a text file. By default, wc counts the number of lines, words, and byte counts in a passage and outputs this information in the following format:

lines words bytes filename

Recall the alpha-first.txt file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat alpha-first.txt
A is for Apple 
B is for Bear
C is for Cat
D is for Dog
E is for Elephant
F is for Flower

Using the wc command on the same file reveals the following:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ wc alpha-first.txt
 6 24 90 alpha-first.txt

The wc command reports that there are 6 lines, containing 24 words, totaling 90 bytes in length. The total number of bytes includes spaces, punctuation, and carriage returns.

To view each of these numbers separately, options can be used:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ wc alpha-first.txt -l
6 alpha-first.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ wc alpha-first.txt -w
24 alpha-first.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ wc alpha-first.txt -m
90 alpha-first.txt

In the example, the -l option was used to count the number of lines. In the second example, the -w option was used to count the number of words. Finally, the -m option indicates the number of characters.

One might imagine that the -c option would count the number of characters, but -c is used to count the number of bytes. The number of bytes can vary if there are non-printable characters in the file. In this case, they are the same:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ wc alpha-first.txt -c
90 alpha-first.txt

One last option, -L returns the maximum line length in the file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ wc alpha-first.txt -L
17 alpha-first.txt

If the word count of all the files in a particular folder is desired, the asterisk wildcard * can be used:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ wc *
  wc: School: Is a directory

wc: Work: Is a directory
