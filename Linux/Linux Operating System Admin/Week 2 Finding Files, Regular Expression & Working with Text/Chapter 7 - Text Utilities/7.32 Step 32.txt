7.32 Step 32

To remove duplicate lines from the output file and display the count of duplicates, execute the following command:

sort output | uniq â€“c

sysadmin@localhost:~$ sort output | uniq -c
      1 /bin/bash
      1 /bin/sync
      8 /usr/sbin/nologin

In the command above, the -u option to the sort command rearranges the rows in the file and then removes duplicates. The uniq command also provides duplicate removal functionality in a slightly different way. It removes duplicates which are already on consecutive lines i.e. it does not sort data.

The uniq command provides another additional option not supported by the sort command; it can display the number of duplicates that were counted.
