7.5 Displaying the Beginning of a File

The purpose of the head command is to view the beginning of a file or output.

head [OPTION]... [FILE]...

By default, the head command will display the first ten lines of a file's contents. For example, the following command displays the first ten lines of the alpha.txt file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ head alpha.txt
A is for Apple
B is for Bear
C is for Cat
D is for Dog
E is for Elephant
F is for Flower
G is for Grapes
H is for Happy
I is for Ink
J is for Juice

There are several options for the head command that are useful. For instance, there is the ability to use a number as an option to indicate how many lines of output to display. For example, to display the first three lines of the alpha.txt file, execute:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ head -3 alpha.txt
A is for Apple
B is for Bear
C is for Cat

There is also the -n option which takes an argument for the number of lines to display. So, the following would also display the first three lines of the alpha.txt file:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ head -n3 alpha.txt
A is for Apple
B is for Bear
C is for Cat

A negative number can also be used as an argument to the -n option, which tells the head command how many lines to omit from the bottom of the file. For example, when executing the head -n -90 command on a file that is 100 lines long, the output would only include the first 10 lines by omitting the last 90.

The alpha.txt file is 26 lines long. The following command omits the last 24 lines, resulting in only the first two lines of the file being displayed:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ head -n -24 alpha.txt
A is for Apple
B is for Bear
