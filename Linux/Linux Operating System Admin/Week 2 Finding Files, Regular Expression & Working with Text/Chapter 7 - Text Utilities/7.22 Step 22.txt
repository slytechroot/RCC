The paste command will merge the lines of one or more files, line by line, separating them with a tab as a delimiter (separator) by default. The paste command is especially useful for files that contain data in column format. The syntax for the paste command is:

paste [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Execute the following commands to create two files named head and tail and then merge them together into a file named total:

head -5 words > head
tail -5 words > tail
paste head tail > total
cat total

sysadmin@localhost:~$ head -5 words > head
sysadmin@localhost:~$ tail -5 words > tail
sysadmin@localhost:~$ paste head tail > total
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat total
