7.2 Step 2

The standard output of the cat command can be sent to another file by using redirection. Standard output redirection is achieved by following a command with the greater-than > character and a destination file.

cat /etc/hosts /etc/hostname > result

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat /etc/hosts /etc/hostname > result

Standard input and output streams will be covered in greater detail later in the course.

To view the result file created above, execute the following command:

cat result

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat result
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
192.168.1.2     localhost
