7.4 Numbering the Output of Files

The nl command will number the lines of its output.

nl [OPTION]... [FILE]...

By default, it only numbers non-empty lines:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ nl newhome.txt
     1  Thanks for purchasing your new home!!
 
     2  **Warning** it may be haunted.
 
     3  There are three bathrooms.
 
     4  **Beware** of the ghost in the bedroom.
 
     5  The kitchen is open for entertaining.
 
     6  **Caution** the spirits don't like guests.
 
     7  Good luck!!!

The nl command offers many formatting options for line numbering, including separate styles for headers, footers, sections, and the body of a file. For example, to have the nl command number every line in the newhome.txt file, execute the following command:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ nl -ba newhome.txt
     1  Thanks for purchasing your new home!!
     2
     3  **Warning** it may be haunted.
     4
     5  There are three bathrooms.
     6
     7  **Beware** of the ghost in the bedroom.
     8
     9  The kitchen is open for entertaining.
    10
    11  **Caution** the spirits don't like guests.
    12
    13  Good luck!!!

In the previous example, the option -ba may cause some confusion as it is really just one option, not two. The -b option is the --body-numbering option, abbreviated in its short version as -b. The a is actually an argument that means number all lines. In other words, the command could also be executed:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ nl -b a newhome.txt

This is one of the reasons some Linux users prefer the long argument technique. Using a long argument, the command could have been written:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ nl --body-numbering=a newhome.txt

Consider This

It is also possible to number lines using the cat -n command with the -n option, which numbers every line by default.
