7.35 Step 35

The sed command is a non-interactive editor that can be used to modify, insert, and delete text based on pattern matching with the specified string. The sed command combined with regular expressions gives very powerful text processing capabilities.

sed [OPTION]... {SCRIPT} [FILE]...

When performing a search and replace operation, the sed command will only replace the first occurrence of the search pattern by default. To replace all occurrences of the pattern, add the global modifier g after the final slash.

s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/g

To replace all occurrences of the word host with the word NAME in the /etc/hosts file globally, execute the following command:

cat /etc/hosts
sed 's/host/NAME/g' /etc/hosts

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
192.168.1.2     localhost
sysadmin@localhost:~$ sed 's/host/NAME/g' /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localNAME
::1     localNAME ip6-localNAME ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
192.168.1.2     localNAME
