7.24 Step 24

The cut command is used to extract fields from a text file. The space and tab are the default delimiters and can be changed using the -d option.

To extract the 1st, 3rd and 4th fields from the /etc/passwd file, execute the following command:

cut –d: -f1,3,4 /etc/passwd | head –n 4

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cut -d: -f1,3,4 /etc/passwd | head -n 4
root:0:0
daemon:1:1
bin:2:2
sys:3:3

In the example above, the head command is used to limit the output of the cut command.
