7.27 Step 27

The sort command is useful for working with data organized in columns. It is used to display a file sorted on a specific field of data.

sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...

To specify the fields to sort from first to last, use the sort command with one or more -k options.

First, view the file adjectives.txt in the Documents directory using the cat command:

cd Documents/
cat adjectives.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Documents/
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat adjectives.txt
1 golden
2 honey
3 fruit
4 grey
5 bald

To sort the adjectives.txt file using the second field (i.e., the adjective: 1 golden) as a key, execute the following command:

sort -k2 adjectives.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ sort -k2 adjectives.txt
5 bald
3 fruit
1 golden
4 grey
2 honey

In the command above, the -k option has one argument: the 2, which indicates the second field to sort.
