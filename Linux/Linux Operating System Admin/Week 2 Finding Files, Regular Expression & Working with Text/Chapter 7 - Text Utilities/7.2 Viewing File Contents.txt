7.2 Viewing File Contents

With a single file argument, the cat command will simply output the contents of a file:

cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Documents                                
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$                                   
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat alpha-first.txt
A is for Animal
B is for Bear‌⁠​​⁠​ 
C is for Cat
D is for Dog
E is for Elephant
F is for Flower
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat alpha-second.txt
G is for Grapes
H is for Happy
I is for Ink
J is for Juice
K is for Kangaroo
L is for Lol
M is for Monkey

However, the cat command gets its name from the word concatenate, meaning to merge or append. This command has the ability to accept two or more files as input and then output the concatenation (merging) of those files:

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat alpha-first.txt alpha-second.txt
A is for Animal
B is for Bear
C is for Cat
D is for Dog
E is for Elephant
F is for Flower
G is for Grapes
H is for Happy
I is for Ink
J is for Juice
K is for Kangaroo
L is for Lol
M is for Monkey

While the cat command is often used to quickly view the contents of small files, using it to display the contents of larger files will result in frustration since the data will be displayed much too quickly and will scroll off the screen. To display the file one page at a time, use a pager, either the more or the less command.

To view a file with the less command, pass the file name as an argument:

less FILE

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ less words

The more and less commands allow users to navigate the document using keystroke commands. For example, when using less as a pager, to advance forward a page, press the Spacebar:
An animated gif demonstrating advancing through a document with the less command.

The less command might look familiar since it is the pager generally used to view man pages. As you may recall, the less command requires the use of movement commands to navigate a file. When viewing a file with the less command, use the H key or Shift + H to display a help screen with a summary of the less commands:

               SUMMARY OF LESS COMMANDS                                     
      Commands marked with * may be preceded by a number, N.      

      Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if N is given.

  q  :q  Q  :Q  ZZ     Exit.

To exit the less command, use the Q key.
