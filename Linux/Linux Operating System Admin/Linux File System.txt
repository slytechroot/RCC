Kali Linux adheres to the filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS),35which provides a familiar and universal layout for all Linux users. The directories you will find most useful are:

•/bin-basic programs (ls, cd, cat, etc.)
•/sbin-system programs (fdisk, mkfs, sysctl, etc)
•/etc-configuration files
•/tmp-temporary files (typically deleted on boot)
•/usr/bin-applications (apt, ncat, nmap, etc.)
•/usr/share-application support and data files

There are many other directories, most of which you will rarely need to enter, but having a good familiarity of the layout of the Linux filesystem will help your efficiency immensely
