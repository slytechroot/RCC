2.9.3 Sections Within Man Pages

Each man page is broken into sections. Each section is designed to provide specific information about a command. While there are common sections that you will see in most man pages, some developers also create sections that you will only see in a specific man page.

The following table describes some of the more common sections that you will find in man pages:
NAME

Provides the name of the command and a very brief description.

NAME                                                                            
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS

A brief summary of the command or function's interface. A summary of how the command line syntax of the program looks.

              prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below

FILES

AUTHOR
