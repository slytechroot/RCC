2.9.6.4 Searching by Keyword

Unfortunately, you won't always remember the exact name of the man page that you want to view. In these cases, you can search for man pages that match a keyword by using the -k option to the man command.

For example, what if you knew you wanted a man page that displays how to change your password, but you didn't remember the exact name? You could run the command man -k password:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ man -k password
chage (1)            - change user password expiry information
chgpasswd (8)        - update group passwords in batch mode
chpasswd (8)         - update passwords in batch mode
cpgr (8)             - copy with locking the given file to the password or gr...
cppw (8)             - copy with locking the given file to the password or gr...

Warning

When you use this option, you may end up with a large amount of output. The preceding command, for example, provided over 60 results.

Recall that there are thousands of man pages, so when you search for a keyword, be as specific as possible. Using a generic word, such as "the" could result in hundreds or even thousands of results.

Note that on most Linux distributions, the apropos command does the same thing as man -k. On those distributions, both will produce the same output.
