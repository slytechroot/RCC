2.9.6.3 Searching by Name

Sometimes it isn't clear which section a man page is stored in. In cases like this, you can search for a man page by name.

The -f option to the man command will display man pages that match, or partially match, a specific name and provide a brief description of each man page:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ man -f passwd
passwd (1ssl)        - compute password hashes
passwd (1)           - change user password
passwd (5)           - the password file

Note that on most Linux distributions, the whatis command does the same thing as man -f. On those distributions, both will produce the same output.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ whatis passwd
passwd (1ssl)        - compute password hashes
passwd (1)           - change user password
passwd (5)           - the password file
