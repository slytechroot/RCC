NAME
     cal, ncal -- displays a calendar and the date of Easter
 
SYNOPSIS
     cal [-3hjy] [-A number] [-B number] [[month] year]
     cal [-3hj] [-A number] [-B number] -m month [year]
     ncal [-3bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-s country_code] [[month]
         year]
     ncal [-3bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [year]
     ncal [-CN] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]
 
DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi-
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.
 
     The options are as follows:
 
     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

Consider This

It is possible to print man pages from the command line. If you wanted to send a man page to a default printer from a local machine, you would execute the following command:

man -t command | lp

The command above will not function in our virtual environment.
