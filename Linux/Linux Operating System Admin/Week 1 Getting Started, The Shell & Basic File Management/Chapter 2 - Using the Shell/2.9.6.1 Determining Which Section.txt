2.9.6.1 Determining Which Section

To determine which section a specific man page belongs to, look at the numeric value on the first line of the output of the man page. For example, if you execute the command man cal, you will see that the cal command belongs to the first section of man pages:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ man cal

‌⁠​​⁠​ 

CAL(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   CAL(1)
