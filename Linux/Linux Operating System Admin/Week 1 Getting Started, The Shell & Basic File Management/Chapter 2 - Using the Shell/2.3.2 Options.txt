2.3.2 Options

command [options] [arguments]

Options can be used with commands to expand or modify the way a command behaves. If it is necessary to add options, they can be specified after the command name. Short options are specified with a hyphen - followed by a single character. Short options are how options were traditionally specified.

In the following example, the -l option is provided to the ls command, which results in a long display output:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Documents
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Downloads
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Music
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Public
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Templates
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Videos

Often the character is chosen to be mnemonic for its purpose, like choosing the letter l for long or r for reverse. By default, the ls command prints the results in alphabetical order, so adding the -r option prints the results in reverse alphabetical order.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -r
Videos  Templates  Public  Pictures  Music  Downloads  Documents  Desktop

In most cases, options can be used in conjunction with other options. They can be given as separate options like -l -r or combined like -lr. The combination of these two options would result in a long listing output in reverse alphabetical order:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l -r
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Videos
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Templates
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Public
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Music
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Downloads
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Documents
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin   0 Sep 18 22:25 Desktop

Multiple single options can be either given as separate options like -a -l -r or combined like -alr. The output of all of these examples would be the same:

ls -l -a -r
ls -rla
ls -a -lr

Generally, short options can be combined with other short options in any order. The exception to this is when an option requires an argument.

For example, the -w option to the ls command specifies the width of the output desired and therefore requires an argument. If combined with other options, the -w option can be specified last, followed by its argument and still be valid, as in ls -rtw 40, which specifies an output width of 40 characters. Otherwise, the -w option cannot be combined with other options and must be given separately.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -lr -w 40                                            
total 32                                                                        
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Videos                    	 
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Templates                 	 
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Public                    	 
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Pictures                  	 
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Music                     	 
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Downloads                 	 
drwxr-xr-x 4 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Documents                 	 
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Feb 22 16:32 Desktop

If you are using multiple options that require arguments, don't combine them. For example, the -T option, which specifies tab size, also requires an argument. In order to accommodate both arguments, each option is given separately:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -w 40 -T 12
Desktop	Music 	Templates
Documents  Pictures  Videos
Downloads  Public

Some commands support additional options that are longer than a single character. Long options for commands are preceded by a double hyphen -- and the meaning of the option is typically the name of the option, like the --all option, which lists all files, including hidden ones. For example:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls --all
.         	.bashrc   .selected_editor  Downloads  Public	 
..        	.cache	Desktop       	Music  	Templates
.bash_logout  .profile  Documents     	Pictures   Videos

For commands that support both long and short options, execute the command using the long and short options concurrently:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls --all --reverse -t
.profile  	Templates  Music  	Desktop       	..                   	 
.bash_logout  Public 	Downloads  .selected_editor  .cache               	 
Videos    	Pictures   Documents  .bashrc       	.

Commands that support long options will often also support arguments that may be specified with or without an equal symbol (the output of both commands is the same):

ls --sort time
ls --sort=time

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls --sort=time
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos

A special option exists, the lone double hyphen -- option, which can be used to indicate the end of all options for the command. This can be useful in some circumstances where it is unclear whether some text that follows the options should be interpreted as an additional option or as an argument to the command.

For example, if the touch command tries to create a file called --badname:
‌⁠​​⁠

sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch --badname
touch: unrecognized option '--badname'
Try 'touch --help' for more information.

The command tries to interpret --badname as an option instead of an argument. However, if the lone double hyphen -- option is placed before the file name, indicating that there are no more options, then the file name can successfully be interpreted as an argument:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch -- --badname
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
--badname  Documents  Music 	Public 	Videos                          	 
Desktop	Downloads  Pictures  Templates

Consider This

The file name in the previous example is considered to be bad because putting hyphens in the beginning of file names, while allowed, can cause problems when trying to access the file. For example, using the ls command without any options to list the path of the --badname file above, will result in an error:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls --badname  
ls: unrecognized option '--badname'   
Try 'ls --help' for more information.

To remove the --badname file from the home directory, use the rm remove command:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm -- --badname

The rm command will be covered in greater detail later in the course.

A third type of option exists for a select few commands. While the options used in the AT&T version of UNIX used a single hyphen and the GNU port of those commands used two hyphens, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) version of UNIX used options with no hyphen at all.

This no hyphen syntax is fairly rare in most Linux distributions. A couple of notable commands that support the BSD UNIX style options are the ps and tar commands; both of these commands also support the single and double hyphen style of options.

In the terminal below, there are two similar commands, the first command is executed with a traditional UNIX style option (with single hyphens) and the second command is executed with a BSD style option (no hyphens).

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ps -u sysadmin
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
   79 ?        00:00:00 bash
  122 ?        00:00:00 ps
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ps u
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
sysadmin    79  0.0  0.0  18176  3428 ?        S    20:23   0:00 -bash
sysadmin   120  0.0  0.0  15568  2040 ?        R+   21:26   0:00 ps u
