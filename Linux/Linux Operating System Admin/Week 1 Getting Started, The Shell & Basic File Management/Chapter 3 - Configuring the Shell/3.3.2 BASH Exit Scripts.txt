3.3.2 BASH Exit Scripts

Just as Bash executes one or more files upon starting up, it also may execute one or more files upon exiting. As Bash exits, it will execute the ~/.bash_logout and /etc/bash_logout files, if they exist. Typically, these files are used for "cleaning up" tactics as the user exits the shell. For example, the default ~/.bash_logout executes the clear command to remove any text present in the terminal screen.

Consider This

When a new user is created, the files from the /etc/skel directory are automatically copied into the new user's home directory. As an administrator, you can modify the files in the/etc/skel directory to provide custom features to new users.
