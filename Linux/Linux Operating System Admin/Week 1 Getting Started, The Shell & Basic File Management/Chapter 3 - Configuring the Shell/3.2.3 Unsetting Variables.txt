3.2.3 Unsetting Variables

If you create a variable and then no longer want that variable to be defined, use the unset command to delete it:

unset VARIABLE

sysadmin@localhost:~$ example=12
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo $example
12
sysadmin@localhost:~$ unset example
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo $example

Warning

Do not unset critical system variables like the PATH variable, as this may lead to a malfunctioning environment.
