3.4.2 Changing Editing Keys

The keys that are available for editing a command are determined by the settings of a library called Readline. The keys are typically set to match the key assignments found within the emacs text editor (a popular Linux editor) by default.

To bind the keys to match the key assignments found with another popular text editor, the vi editor. The shell can be configured with the set -o vi command. To set the key bindings back to the emacs text editor, use the set -o emacs command.

Note

If you don't know how to use the vi editor yet, you may want to stick with the emacs keys as the vi editor has a bigger learning curve.

The vi editor will be covered in greater detail later in the course.

To automatically configure the edit history options at login, edit the ~/.inputrc file. If this file doesn't exist, the /etc/inputrc file is used instead. Key bindings are set differently in configuration files than on the command line; for example, to enable the vi key binding mode for an individual, add the following lines to the ~/.inputrc file:
‌⁠​​

set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi

If the situation is reversed, perhaps due to the above two lines being added to the /etc/inputrc file, a user can enable the emacs mode by adding the following lines to the ~/.inputrc file:

set editing-mode emacs
set keymap emacs
