3.2.2 Displaying Variables

There are several ways to display the values of variables. The set command by itself will display all variables (local and environment) Here, we will pipe the output to the tail command so we can see some of the variables that were set in the previous section:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ set | tail
DEPARTMENT=science                                                                 	 
SHELL=/bin/bash                                                            	 
SHELLOPTS=braceexpand:emacs:hashall:histexpand:history:interactive-comments:monitor                                                                    	SHLVL=1                                                                    	 
TERM=xterm                                                                 	 
UID=1001                                                                   	 
USER=sysadmin                                                              	 
VISUAL=vi                                                                  	 
_=set                                                                      	 
name=judy

Note

The example above utilizes a command line pipe, represented by the | character. The pipe character can be used to send the output of one command to another.

The command line pipes will be covered in greater detail later in the course.

Note

The tail command is used to display only the last few lines of a file, (or, when used with a pipe, the output of a previous command). By default, the tail command displays ten lines of a file provided as an argument.

The tail command will be covered in greater detail later in the course.

To display only environment variables, you can use several commands that provide nearly the same output:

env
declare -x
typeset -x
export -p

sysadmin@localhost:~$ env | tail
NAME=judy                                                                  	 
MAIL=/var/mail/sysadmin                                                    	 
SHELL=/bin/bash                                                            	 
TERM=xterm                                                                 	 
SHLVL=1                                                                    	 
EDUCATION=masters                                                          	 
LOGNAME=sysadmin                                                           	 
PATH=/home/sysadmin/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:
/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games                                           	 
LESSOPEN=| /usr/bin/lesspipe %s                                            	 
_=/usr/bin/env

To display the value of a specific variable, use the echo command with the name of the variable prefixed by the $ (dollar sign). For example, to display the value of the PATH variable, you would execute echo $PATH:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo $PATH
/home/sysadmin/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games

Consider This

Variables can also be enclosed in the curly brace {} characters in order to delimit them from surrounding text. While the echo ${PATH} command would produce the same result as the echo $PATH command, the curly braces set the variable apart visually, making it easier to see in scripts in some contexts.
