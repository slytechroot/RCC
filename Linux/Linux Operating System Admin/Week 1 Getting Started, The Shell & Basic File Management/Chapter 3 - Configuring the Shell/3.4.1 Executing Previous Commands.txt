3.4.1 Executing Previous Commands

The Bash shell will allow a user to use the Up ↑ Arrow Key to view previous commands. With each press of the up arrow, the shell displays one more command back in the history list.

If the user goes back too far, the Down ↓ Arrow Key can be used to return to a more recent command. Once the correct command is displayed, the Enter key can be pressed to execute it.

The Left ← and Right → Arrow Keys can also be used to position the cursor within the command. The Backspace and Delete keys are used to remove text, and additional characters can be typed into the command line to modify it before pressing the Enter key to execute it.

There are more keys that can be used for editing a command on the command line. The following table summarizes some helpful editing keys:
Action 					Key 	Alternate Key Combination
Previous history item 			↑ 	Ctrl+P
Next history item 			↓ 	Ctrl+N
