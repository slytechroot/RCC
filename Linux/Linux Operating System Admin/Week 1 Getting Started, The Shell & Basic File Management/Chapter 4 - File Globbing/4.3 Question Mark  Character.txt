4.3 Question Mark ? Character

The question mark ? character in a string will match exactly one character. For example, to see all of the files in the /usr/bin directory that only have one character in the file name, use the /usr/bin/? pattern:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd /usr/bin
sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo /usr/bin/? 
/usr/bin/[ /usr/bin/w

By adding more question mark ? characters, it is possible to match additional characters. In order to see which files had two or three characters as their file names, execute the following two echo commands:

sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo ??
‌⁠​​⁠​ du ex hd id nl od pg pr sg tr ul vi wc xz
sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo ???
a2p apt awk cal cmp col cut dig env eqn fmt gpg lcf ldd man pdb pic ptx rcp rev
rsh s2p scp see seq ssh sum tac tbl tee tic toe top tty ucf who xxd yes zip

The incorporation of other characters to patterns using the question mark ? character, including other wildcard characters, allow for more specific searches. For example, the w?? pattern will match files that started with the letter w, and are exactly three characters long:

sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo w??
who

While the w??* pattern will match files that started with the letter w, but are at least three characters long:

sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo w??*
w.procps wall watch wget whatis whereis which who whoami write
