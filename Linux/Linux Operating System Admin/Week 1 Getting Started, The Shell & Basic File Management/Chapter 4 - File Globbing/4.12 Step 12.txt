4.12 Step 12

If the first character inside of the square brackets is either an exclamation ! character or a caret ^ character, then that first character has a special meaning of not the following characters.

To view the file names that begin with rc in the /etc directory, excluding those containing the numbers 3-6, execute the following command:

echo /etc/rc[^3-6]*

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/rc[^3-6]*                          
/etc/rc0.d /etc/rc1.d /etc/rc2.d /etc/rcS.d

Alternatively, you can use the exclamation point ! character to match the pattern from the previous step:

echo /etc/rc[!3-6]*

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/rc[!3-6]*                          
/etc/rc0.d /etc/rc1.d /etc/rc2.d /etc/rcS.d
