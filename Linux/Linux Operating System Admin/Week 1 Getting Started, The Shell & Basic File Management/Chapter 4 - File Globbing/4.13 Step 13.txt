4.13 Step 13

To view all files with names beginning with rc in the /etc directory except for those that include the number 1, execute the following command:

echo /etc/rc[!1]*

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo /etc/rc[!1]*                             
/etc/rc0.d /etc/rc2.d /etc/rc3.d /etc/rc4.d /etc/rc5.d /etc/rc6.d /etc/rcS.d

Note

The wildcard characters lose their special meaning inside the [] notation and are treated as regular characters. For example, if you specify [*]*, it will try to match with a file name starting with the asterisk * character. Typically file names don't include wildcard characters, so this feature is rarely needed.
