4.2 Asterisk * Character

The asterisk* wildcard can be used to match any string, including the empty string.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo *â€Œ

An empty string is a string that has nothing in it. It is commonly referred to as "".

In order to limit the * wildcard, so that it matches fewer file names, it can be combined with other characters. For example, the D* pattern will only match file names that start with a D character:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo D*

The * character can appear anywhere in the pattern; it can even appear multiple times. It is possible to find a file that not only starts with a D, but also contains the letter n, by using the D*n* pattern:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo D*n*
