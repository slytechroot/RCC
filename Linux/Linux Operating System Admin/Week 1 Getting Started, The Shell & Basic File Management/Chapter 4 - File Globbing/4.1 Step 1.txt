4.1 Step 1

To display the names of all files in your current working directory, execute the echo command with the asterisk * character as the argument:

echo *

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo *                                        
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public Templates Videos

The echo command can be used to see which files a glob pattern will match. The asterisk * character is a wildcard pattern that is used for matching any string, including an empty string.

In the output above, all the files in your current working directory are displayed.
