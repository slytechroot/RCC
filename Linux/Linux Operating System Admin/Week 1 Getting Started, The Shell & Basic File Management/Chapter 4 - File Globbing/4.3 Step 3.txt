4.3 Step 3

The asterisk * character can be used at any position within the pattern. To list all files and directories with names starting with the letter D and containing the letter n, execute the following command:

echo D*n*

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo D*n*                                     
Documents Downloads                                                             
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo D*N*                                     
D*N*

Important

In Linux, file names are case sensitive. So, the output of D*n* will be different from that of D*N*. Also, the shell will not match files starting with a period . character when it matches an asterisk * character, as these are special files called hidden files.
