4.1 Introduction

File globbing might sound like an unusual term, but the concept of globbing is probably a familiar one. Like a joker in a deck of cards, which you might be able to use as any card (a wildcard), glob characters are special characters that can be used to match file or path names.

For the details of how globbing works, you can view the man page on glob in section 7 of the manual pages by executing:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ man 7 glob

â€Œ

From that manual page:

    A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains one of the characters '?', '*', or '['. Globbing is the operation that expands a wildcard pattern into the list of path names matching the pattern.

The shell is what performs the expansion of the wildcards; therefore, the use of globbing is not limited to a particular command. Globbing is especially useful for file management since it can be used to match the path names to files that you want to manage.
