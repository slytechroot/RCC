5.4 Creating and Modifying Files

The touch command performs two functions. It can create an empty file or update the modification timestamp on an existing file.

touch [OPTION]... FILE...

If the argument provided is an existing file, then the touch command will update the file's timestamp:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l Documents/red.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 51 Feb 22 16:32 Documents/red.txt 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch Documents/red.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l Documents/red.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 51 Mar  8 02:59 Documents/red.txt 

If the argument is a file that does not exist, a new file is created with the current time for the timestamp. The contents of this new file will be empty:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch newfile
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  newfile
Documents  Music      Public    Videos	 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l newfile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Mar  8 03:00 newfile

Each file has three timestamps:

    The last time the file's contents were modified. This is the timestamp provided by the ls -l command by default. The touch command modified this timestamp by default.

    The last time the file was accessed. To modify this timestamp, use the -a option with the touch command.

    The last time the file attributes were modified. These file attributes, which include permissions and file ownership, are also called the file's metadata. To modify this timestamp, use the -c option with the touch command.

The touch command will normally update the specified time to the current time, but the -t option with a timestamp value can be used instead.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch -t 201912251200 newfile
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l newfile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Dec 25  2019 newfile

In the above command, the date/time syntax for the touch command is CCYYMMDDHHMM (optionally add SS for the seconds). The table below breaks down the date/time structure used in the example above in greater detail:
Syntax 	Example 	Meaning
CC 	20 	The century
YY 	19 	The year
MM 	12 	The month
DD 	25 	The day
HH 	12 	The hour
MM 	00 	The minutes

Because the example above uses the precise time of 12:00 AM, we donâ€™t need to put 00 in the seconds (SS) field.

In order to view all three timestamps that are kept for a file, use the stat command with the path to the file as an argument:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ stat Documents/alpha.txt                                       
  File: Documents/alpha.txt

To create a file with the touch command, you must have the write and execute permission on the parent directory. If the file already exists, modifying it with the touch command only requires the write permission on the file itself.
Command 	File Type 	Permission
touch NEW_FILE 	Parent Directory 	Write, Execute
touch EXISTING_FILE 	File 	Write
