5.9 Removing Directories

The rmdir command is used to remove empty directories:

rmdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...

sysadmin@localhost:~$ rmdir bin

Using the -p option with the rmdir command will remove directory paths, but only if all of the directories contain other empty directories.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ rmdir red
rmdir: failed to remove 'red': Directory not empty
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rmdir -p red/blue/yellow/green

Otherwise, if a directory contains anything except other directories, you'll need to use the rm command with a recursive option. The rm command alone will ignore directories that it's asked to remove; to delete a directory, use either the -r or -R recursive options. Just be careful as this will delete all files and all subdirectories:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ mkdir test
sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch test/file1.txt 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rmdir test
rmdir: failed to remove 'test': Directory not empty
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm test                                 
rm: cannot remove 'test': Is a directory     
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm -r test
sysadmin@localhost:~$

To delete a directory with the rmdir command, you must have the write and execute permission on the parent directory. For example, to remove the /etc/test directory requires the write and execute permissions in the /etc directory.
