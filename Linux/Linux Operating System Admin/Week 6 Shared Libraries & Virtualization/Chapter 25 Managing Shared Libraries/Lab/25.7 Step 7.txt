25.7 Step 7

Delete the previously created mylib.conf configuration file in the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory:

rm /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mylib.conf
y

[root@localhost ~]# rm /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mylib.conf  
rm: remove regular file `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/mylib.conf'? y

Now, verify that the directory is no longer used by the ldconfig command:

ldconfig -v | grep mylib

[root@localhost ~]# ldconfig -v | grep mylib
ldconfig: Can't stat /libx32: No such file or directory            
ldconfig: Path `/usr/lib' given more than once                      
ldconfig: Path `/usr/lib64' given more than once                   
ldconfig: Can't stat /usr/libx32: No such file or directory

In most cases, if you are deleting the configuration file permanently, then you could also delete the directory that contains the libraries (/usr/mylib in this case).
