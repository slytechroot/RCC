24.3.3 Updating Packages With yum

Using the yum list updates command will cause the system to connect to repositories on the internet to identify newer versions or releases of packages and list them. By using the yum update command, the system will download and update all possible packages after requesting confirmation.

To update one or more individual packages, the following syntax can be used:

yum update [PACKAGE]...

As previously mentioned with the rpm command, the kernel packages should always be installed and not updated. This applies to the rpm command, but not to the yum command because yum is aware of the special nature of the kernel package. Even if the command yum update kernel is used, the yum command will install an updated kernel, not update it.
