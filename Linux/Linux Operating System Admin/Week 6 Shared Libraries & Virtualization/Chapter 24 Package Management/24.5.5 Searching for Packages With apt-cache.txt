24.5.5 Searching for Packages With apt-cache

If the system has the appropriate repositories configured in the /etc/apt/sources.list file and the administrator has already refreshed the cached information about which packages are available by executing the apt-get update command, then any user can search for packages by using the apt-cache search command with the following syntax:

apt-cache search KEYWORD

The keyword that is used should match part of the name or description of the package to be located. Multiple keywords can be used to clarify the search further; for example, the apt-cache search web server command would provide better results than the apt-cache search web or apt-cache search server command.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ apt-cache search medusa
medusa - fast, parallel, modular, login brute-forcer for network services
python-medusa - Framework for implementing asynchronous servers
python-medusa-doc - Framework for implementing asynchronous servers

The apt-cache command can also search for packages in a different way. To find out which dependencies a package has, the apt-cache depends PACKAGE command will list the packages required by the package-name. For example, to determine the dependencies of the apache2 package, execute the apt-cache depends apache2 command.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ apt-cache depends apache2
apache2
  PreDepends: dpkg
  Depends: lsb-base
  Depends: procps

â€ŠThe apt-cache show PACKAGE command can also display the status of a package with information similar to the output of the dpkg -s PACKAGE command, but the apt-cache command displays more detailed information, including checksums that could be used to verify the original package.
