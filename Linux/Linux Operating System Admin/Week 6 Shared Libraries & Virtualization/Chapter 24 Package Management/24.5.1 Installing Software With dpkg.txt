24.5.1 Installing Software With dpkg

To install a software package in a Debian-based distribution, use the -i option with the dpkg command. For example, to install the joe_3.7-2.3_i386.deb file, execute:

Note

The following examples represent a system that is different from the virtual machine in this module. The examples may not match the output in our virtual environment.

Additional practice for Debian package management is provided in the lab.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ dpkg -i joe_3.7-2.3_i386.deb

Debian packages also may have dependencies. There are four categories of dependencies: depends, recommends, suggests, and enhances. Only the depends category reflects a package that must be installed in order to have the required dependencies met.

As a low-level tool, dpkg does not provide any automatic way to resolve dependency issues. However, the APT tool apt-get does have this capability, as will be discussed later in this chapter.
