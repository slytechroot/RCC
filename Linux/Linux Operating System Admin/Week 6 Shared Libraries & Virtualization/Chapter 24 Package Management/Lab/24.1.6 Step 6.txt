Display the status of the package files by executing the following command:

rpm -q -s setup | head

[root@localhost /]# rpm -q -s setup | head
normal        /etc/aliases
normal        /etc/bashrc
normal        /etc/csh.cshrc
normal        /etc/csh.login
normal        /etc/environment
normal        /etc/exports
normal        /etc/filesystems
normal        /etc/fstab
normal        /etc/group
normal        /etc/gshadow

Typically, this output should indicate normal for each file. If a file has not been installed, it will be listed as not installed. This could result in the package not functioning correctly.
