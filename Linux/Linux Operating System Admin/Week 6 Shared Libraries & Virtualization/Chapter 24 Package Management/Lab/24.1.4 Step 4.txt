To view the scripts that are included with the package, execute the following command:

rpm -qi --scripts setup

[root@localhost /]# rpm -q --scripts setup
postinstall scriptlet (using <lua>):
for i, name in ipairs({"passwd", "shadow", "group", "gshadow"}) do
     os.remove("/etc/"..name..".rpmnew")
end
if posix.access("/usr/bin/newaliases", "x") then
  os.execute("/usr/bin/newaliases >//dev/null")
end

Note that in the example output provided, the postinstall scriptlet would be executed immediately after the package was installed.
