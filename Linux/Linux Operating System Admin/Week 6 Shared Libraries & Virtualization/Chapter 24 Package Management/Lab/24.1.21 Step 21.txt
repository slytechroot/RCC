24.1.21 Step 21

Type the letter i to enter Insert mode and then type the following:

[Local]
name=Local
baseurl=file:///mnt/local_repo
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1

The baseurl setting defines where the RPM files are stored. Normally this would be a network-based address, either http or ftp based. The gpgcheck setting is set to 0 to prevent the yum command from checking the digital signature of the packages. The enabled setting is set to 1 in order to make use of this repository.
