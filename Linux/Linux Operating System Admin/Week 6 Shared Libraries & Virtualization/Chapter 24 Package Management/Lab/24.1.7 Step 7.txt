24.1.7 Step 7

Remove the quota package from the system with the following rpm command:

rpm -e quota

[root@localhost /]# rpm -e quota
[root@localhost /]#

Recall that the rpm command doesn't check for any package dependencies. As a result, you would not see any warning if another package depended on the quota package.
