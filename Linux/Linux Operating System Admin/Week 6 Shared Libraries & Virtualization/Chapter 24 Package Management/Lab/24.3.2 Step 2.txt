24.3.2 Step 2

The syntax used for the zypper command examples in this course is the following:

zypper [--global-opts] command [--command-opts] [command-arguments]

To begin using the zypper command, first ensure that the command has updated information about repositories by using the following command:

zypper ref

localhost:~ # zypper ref                                                        
Repository 'localrepo' is up to date.                                           
All repositories have been refreshed.

Please allow a few minutes for this command to produce output.
