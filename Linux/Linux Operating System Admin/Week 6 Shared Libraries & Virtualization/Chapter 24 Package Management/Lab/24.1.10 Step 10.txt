24.1.10 Step 10

To demonstrate the use of the rpm2cpio command, first remove the /usr/sbin/edquota file:

rm /usr/sbin/edquota
y

[root@localhost /]# rm /usr/sbin/edquota
rm: remove regular file `/usr/sbin/edquota'? y

Remember that the rpm2cpio command is useful in that it will allow you to extract files from the rpm without installing the files. This is useful to recover a single file from the package (such as when you accidentally delete a key software file like edquota).
