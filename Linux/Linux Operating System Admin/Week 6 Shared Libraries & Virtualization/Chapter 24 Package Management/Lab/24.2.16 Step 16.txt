Description: Utilities for managing the XFS filesystem                          
 A set of commands to use the XFS filesystem, including mkfs.xfs.               
 .                                                                              
 XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated    
on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can                
 support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,                
 variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of              
 Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance              
 and scalability.
