24.2.3 Erasing Packages with rpm

The rpm command can be used to erase (remove) packages from the system with the -e option. However, dependency issues may arise. If there were dependency issues when a group of packages was installed, then there may also be dependency issues when that group of packages is removed.

For example, if an attempt was made to remove the x3270 or libicu packages without first removing the x3270-x11 package, then an error would occur:

[sysadmin@localhost ~]$ rpm -e x3270 libicu
error: Failed dependencies:
	x3270 = 3.3.6 is needed by (installed) x3270-x11-3.3.6-10.5.el6.i686
        libicuuc.so.42 is needed by (installed) x3270-x11-3.3.6-10.5.el6.i686

In other words, the rpm command will not allow a package to be erased if it is a requirement of another package. If the x3270-x11 package were erased first, then the other two packages could be erased.

In the case of circular dependencies, when packages depend on each other, then all the packages can be removed with a single rpm command by specifying all package names as an argument:

[sysadmin@localhost ~]$ rpm -e x3270-x11 x3270 libicu
