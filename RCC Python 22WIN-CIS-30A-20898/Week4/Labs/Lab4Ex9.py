#1.	Refer to week 4 notes. Describe 4 types of inheritance in classes.

from tkinter import MULTIPLE


1. Single - is when a class or subclass inherits methods and attributes from 
            one parent class.
2. Multilevel - a class or subclass inherits methods and attributes from MULTIPLE
                classes. 
3. Hierarchical - happens when more than one class is derived from a single parent or
                base class. 
4. Multiple inheritances - when a class inherits the methods and functions of other classes 
                that also inherit them from other classes, the process is known as multilevel
                inheritance.
