Explain the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?

- a class is a blueprint for the object. It will contains all the details about the floors,
windows, doors, etc. 

- a class create a new local namespace with all its attributes; attributes can be data or
functions.

- a class variable = is a variable shared by all the class instances and objects
- an instance variable = is a variable unique to an instance of a class, defined within
a method and will only apply to the instance of that class.
